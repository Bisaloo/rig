    rim - manage R installations

const HELP_RESOLVE: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Resolve R versions. Check the version number of an R version (e.g.
    release, devel, etc.), and look up the URL of the installer for it,
    if an installer is available.

    It prints the R version number, and after a space the URL of the
    installer. If no installer is available for this R version and the
    current platform, the URL is `NA`.

    An R version can be specified in various ways:
    - `rim resolve devel` is the latest available development version,
    - `rim resolve release` is the latest release.
    - `rim resolve x.y.z` is a specific version.
    - `rim resolve x.y` is the latest release within the `x.y` minor branch.
    - `rim resolve oldrel/n` is the latest release within the `n`th previous
      minor branch (`oldrel` is the same as `oldrel/1`).

    # Latest release (that has an installer available)
    rim resolve release

    # URL for a specific version
    rim resolve 4.1.2

"#;

const HELP_DEFAULT_EXAMPLES: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
    # Query default R version
    rim default

    # Set the default version
    rim default 4.1
"#;

const HELP_LIST: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    TODO
"#;

const HELP_ADD: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Download and install an R version, from the official sources.
    It keeps the already installed R versions.
"#;

const HELP_ADD_EXAMPLES: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
    # Add the latest development snapshot
    rim add devel

    # Add the latest release
    rim add release

    # Install specific version
    rim add 4.1.2

    # Install latest version within a minor branch
    rim add 4.1
"#;

const HELP_RM: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Remove an R installation. It keeps the users' package libraries.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Various commands to modify and configure the installed R versions.
    See their help pages for details. E.g. run `rim system make-links --help`.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM_LINKS: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Create quick links in `/usr/local/bin` for the current R installations.
    This lets you directly run a specific R version. E.g. `R-4.1` will start
    R 4.1.x.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM_LIB: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Create directories for the current user's package libraries, for all
    current R versions.

    `rim add` runs `rim system create-lib`, so if you only use rim to
    install R, then you do not need to run it manually.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM_ADDPAK: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Install/update pak for one or more R versions.

    * If `--all` is specified, then it installs pak for all current R
      installations.
    * If one or more R versions are specified, then it installs pak for
      those.
    * If no R versions are specified, then it installs pak for the default
      R installation (see `rim default`).
