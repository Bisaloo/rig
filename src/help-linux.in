  Resolve R versions. Check the version number of an R version (e.g.
  release, devel, etc.), and look up the URL of the installer for it,
  if an installer is available.

  It prints the R version number, and after a space the URL of the
  installer. If no installer is available for this R version and the
  current platform, the URL is `NA`.

  An R version can be specified in various ways:
  - `rig resolve devel` is the latest available development version,
  - `rig resolve next` is the next (patched, alpha, beta, etc.) version,
  - `rig resolve release` is the latest release.
  - `rig resolve x.y.z` is a specific version.
  - `rig resolve x.y` is the latest release within the `x.y` minor branch.
  - `rig resolve oldrel/n` is the latest release within the `n`th previous
    minor branch (`oldrel` is the same as `oldrel/1`).";

  Print or set the default R version. The default R version is the one that
  is started with the `R` command, via the `/usr/local/bin/R` symbolic link.

  Call without any arguments to see the current default. Call with the
  version number/name to set the default. Before setting a default, you
  can call `rig list` to see the installed R versions.

  The default R version is set by updating the symbolic link at
  `/opt/R/current` and pointing it to the specified R version. If you have
  never set the default version, then there is no default.

  You need to run this command with `sudo` to change the default version:
  `sudo rig default ...`.

  You don't need to update the default R version to just run a non-default R
  version. You can use the `R-<ver>` links, see `rig system make-links`.

  `rig switch` is an alias of `rig default`.";

\x1b[4m\x1b[1mDescription:\x1b[22m\x1b[24m
  Download and install an R version, from the official sources.
  It keeps the already installed R versions.

  rig uses the Posit R builds from `https://github.com/rstudio/r-builds`
  on Linux.

  The desired R version can be specified in various ways:
  - `rig add devel` adds the latest available development version,
  - `rig add next` is the next version (patched, alpha, beta, rc, etc.),
  - `rig add release` adds the latest release.
  - `rig add x.y.z` adds a specific version.
  - `rig add x.y` adds the latest release within the `x.y` minor branch.
  - `rig add oldrel/n` adds the latest release within the `n`th previous
    minor branch (`oldrel` is the same as `oldrel/1`).

  You need to run this command with `sudo`: `sudo rig add ...`,
  otherwise rig will need to ask for your password.

  `rig add` will automatically call `rig system forget` before the
  installation, to make sure that already installed R versions are kept.
  `rig add` will also call the following rig command after the installation:
  - `rig system create-lib`
  - `rig system make-links`
  See their help pages for details.";

  Create quick links in `/usr/local/bin` for the current R installations.
  This lets you directly run a specific R version. E.g. `R-4.1.2` will start
  R 4.1.2.

  `rig add` runs `rig system make-links`, so if you only use rig to
  install R, then you do not need to run it manually.

  This command probably needs `sudo`: `sudo rig system make-links`,
  otherwise rig will ask for your password.";

  R version. If the same exact version is not installed, then rig chooses
  the latest version with the same major and minor components. If no such
  version is available, rig throws an error.
