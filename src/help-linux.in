    rim - manage R installations

DESCRIPTION
    rim manages your R installations, on macOS, Windows, and Linux. It can
    install and set up multiple versions R, and make sure that they work
    together.

    rim is currently experimental and is a work in progress. Feedback is much
    appreciated. See https://github.com/gaborcsardi/rim for bug reports.

    # Add the latest development snapshot

    # Add the latest release
    rim add release

    # Install specific version
    rim add 4.1.2

    # Install latest version within a minor branch
    rim add 4.1

    # List installed versions
    rim list

    # Set default version
    rim default 4.1.2
"#;

const HELP_RESOLVE: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Resolve R versions. Check the version number of an R version (e.g.
    release, devel, etc.), and look up the URL of the installer for it,
    if an installer is available.

    It prints the R version number, and after a space the URL of the
    installer. If no installer is available for this R version and the
    current platform, the URL is `NA`.

    An R version can be specified in various ways:
    - `rim resolve devel` is the latest available development version,
    - `rim resolve next` is the next (patched, alpha, beta, etc.) version,
    - `rim resolve release` is the latest release.
    - `rim resolve x.y.z` is a specific version.
    - `rim resolve x.y` is the latest release within the `x.y` minor branch.
    - `rim resolve oldrel/n` is the latest release within the `n`th previous
      minor branch (`oldrel` is the same as `oldrel/1`).
"#;

const HELP_RESOLVE_EXAMPLES: &str = r#"EXAMPLES
    # Latest development snapshot
    rim resolve devel

    # Latest release (that has an installer available)
    rim resolve release

    # URL for a specific version
    rim resolve 4.1.2

    # Latest version within a minor branch
    rim resolve 4.1
"#;

const HELP_DEFAULT: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Print or set the default R version. The default R version is the one that
    is started with the `R` command, via the `/usr/local/bin/R` symbolic link.

    Call without any arguments to see the current default. Call with the
    version number/name to set the default. Before setting a default, you
    can call `rim list` to see the installed R versions.

    The default R version is set by updating the symbolic link at
    `/opt/R/current` and pointing it to the specified R version. If you have
    never set the default version, then there is no default.

    You need to run this command with `sudo` to change the default version:
    `sudo rim default ...`.

    You don't need to update the default R version to just run a non-default R
    version. You can use the `R-<ver>` links, see `rim system make-links`.

    `rim switch` is an alias of `rim default`.
"#;

const HELP_DEFAULT_EXAMPLES: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
    # Query default R version
    rim default

    # Set the default version
    rim default 4.1.2
"#;

const HELP_LIST: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    List installed R versions from `/opt/R`. It does _not_ check if they are
    working properly.

    `rim ls` is an alias.
"#;

const HELP_ADD: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Download and install an R version, from the official sources.
    It keeps the already installed R versions.

    rim uses the RStudio R builds from `https://github.com/rstudio/r-builds`
    on Linux.

    The desired R version can be specified in various ways:
    - `rim add devel` adds the latest available development version,
    - `rim add next` is the next version (patched, alpha, beta, rc, etc.),
    - `rim add release` adds the latest release.
    - `rim add x.y.z` adds a specific version.
    - `rim add x.y` adds the latest release within the `x.y` minor branch.
    - `rim add oldrel/n` adds the latest release within the `n`th previous
      minor branch (`oldrel` is the same as `oldrel/1`).

    You need to run this command with `sudo`: `sudo rim add ...`,
    otherwise rim will need to ask for your password.

    `rim add` will automatically call `rim system forget` before the
    installation, to make sure that already installed R versions are kept.
    `rim add` will also call the following rim command after the installation:
    - `rim system create-lib`
    - `rim system make-links`
    See their help pages for details.
"#;

const HELP_ADD_EXAMPLES: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
    # Add the latest development snapshot
    rim add devel

    # Add the latest release
    rim add release

    # Install specific version
    rim add 4.1.2

    # Install latest version within a minor branch
    rim add 4.1
"#;

const HELP_RM: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Remove an R installation. It keeps the users' package libraries.

    Usually you need to run this command with `sudo`: `sudo rim rm ...`,
    otherwise rim will ask for your password.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Various commands to modify and configure the installed R versions.
    See their help pages for details. E.g. run `rim system make-links --help`.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM_LINKS: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Create quick links in `/usr/local/bin` for the current R installations.
    This lets you directly run a specific R version. E.g. `R-4.1.2` will start
    R 4.1.2.

    `rim add` runs `rim system make-links`, so if you only use rim to
    install R, then you do not need to run it manually.

    This command probably needs `sudo`: `sudo rim system make-links`,
    otherwise rim will ask for your password.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM_LIB: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Create directories for the current user's package libraries, for all
    current R versions.

    `rim add` runs `rim system create-lib`, so if you only use rim to
    install R, then you do not need to run it manually.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM_ADDPAK: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Install/update pak for one or more R versions.

    * If `--all` is specified, then it installs pak for all current R
      installations.
    * If one or more R versions are specified, then it installs pak for
      those.
    * If no R versions are specified, then it installs pak for the default
      R installation (see `rim default`).
"#;

const HELP_RSTUDIO: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Start RStudio with the specified R version (not implemented yet).
