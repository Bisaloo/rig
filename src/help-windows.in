const HELP_ABOUT: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    rim manages your R installations, on macOS and Windows. It can install
    and set up multiple versions R, and it makes sure that they work
    together.

    rim is currently experimental and work in progress. Feedback is much
    appreciated. See https://github.com/gaborcsardi/rim for bug reports.

"#;

const HELP_RESOLVE: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION:
    Resolve R versions. Check the version number of an R version (e.g.
    release, devel, etc.), and looks up the URL of the installer for it,
    if an installer is available.

    It prints the R version number, and after a space the URL of the
    installer. If no installer is available for this R version and the
    current platform, the URL is `NA`.

    An R version can be specified in various ways:
    - `rim resolve devel` is the latest available development version,
    - `rim resolve release` is the latest release.
    - `rim resolve x.y.z` is a specific version.
    - `rim resolve x.y` is the latest release within the `x.y` minor branch.
    - `rim resolve oldrel/n` is the latest release within the `n`th previous
      minor branch (`oldrel` is the same as `oldrel/1`).

    rim resolve 4.1.2

    # Latest version within a minor branch

"#;

const HELP_DEFAULT: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Print or set the default R version. The default R version is the one
    that can be started with the `R` and `RS` commands, via quick
    batch files at `C:\Program Files\R\bin`.

    Call without any arguments to see the current default. Call with the
    version number/name to set the default. Before setting a default, you
    can call `rim list` to see the installed R versions.

    Potentially you need to run this command from an admininstrator shell
    to change the current default.

    You don't need to update the default R version to just run a non-default R
    version. You can use the `R-<ver>` links, see `rim system make-links`.

KNOWN ISSUES:
    - If you don't call `rim system default <ver>` to set the default R
      version then there is no default, and there are no `R` and `RS`
      commands.
    - If you delete the default R version with `rim rm` or another way,
      then the `R` and `RS` commands will kept, but they will point to a
      non-existing directory and fail.

const HELP_LIST: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    List installed R versions at `C:\Program Files\R`.
    It does _not_ check if they are working properly.
"#;

const HELP_ADD: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Download and install an R version, from the official sources.
    It keeps the already installed R versions.

    The desired R version can be specified in various ways:
    - `rim add devel` adds the latest available development version,
    - `rim add release` adds the latest release.
    - `rim add x.y.z` adds a specific version.
    - `rim add x.y` adds the latest release within the `x.y` minor branch.
    - `rim add oldrel/n` adds the latest release within the `n`th previous
      minor branch (`oldrel` is the same as `oldrel/1`).
    - `rim add <url>` uses a `.pkg` installer from `<url>`.

    `rim add` will call the following rim command after the installation,
    to set up the newly installed version:
    - `rim system create-lib`
    - `rim system make-links`
    See their help pages for details.

    It will also update the sytem profile of all installed versions to add
    the appropriate versions of Rtools to the system PATH.

    You can use `rim add` to install Rtools:

    rim add rtools

    will install all Rtools versions that are needed for the currently
    installed R versions. You can also request a specific Rtools version,
    e.g. `rim add rtools40`. Rtools versions 3.x all install to `C:\Rtools`,
    so only one of them can be installed at a time.

    Usually you need to run this command from an administrator shell.

KNOWN ISSUE:
    - Rtools installation will fail if the same version of Rtools is
      already installed.

    rim add 4.1

    # Install all needed Rtools versions
    rim add rtools
"#;

const HELP_RM: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Remove an R installation. It keeps the users' package libraries.

    Usually you need to run this command from an administrator shell.

KNOWN ISSUE:
    - `rim rm` currently does not remove quick link
      (see `rim system make-links`) for the deleted R version.
    - `rim rm` does not remove the deleted R version from the system
      registry currently.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Various commands to modify and configure the installed R versions.
    See their help pages for details. E.g. run `rim system make-links --help`.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM_LINKS: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Create quick links in `C:\Program Files\R\bin` for the current R
    installations. This lets you directly run a specific R version. E.g.
     `R-4.1.2` will start R 4.1.2.

    It also adds an `R` and `RS` link that runs the default R version.
    See `rim default`.

    `rim add` runs `rim system make-links`, so if you only use rim to
    install R, then you do not need to run it manually.

    Usually you need to run this command from an administrator shell.

KNOWN ISSUE:
    - `rim system make-links` currently does not remove the links that
      are not in use.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM_LIB: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Create directories for the current user's package libraries, for all
    current R versions. It is better to keep packages in a user library,
    because then they are not wiped out by a minor R (re)install.

    `rim add` runs `rim system create-lib`, so if you only use rim to
    install R, then you do not need to run it manually.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM_ADDPAK: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Install/update pak for one or more R versions.

    * If `--all` is specified, then it installs pak for all current R
      installations.
    * If one or more R versions are specified, then it installs pak for
      those.
    * If no R versions are specified, then it installs pak for the default
      R installation, if there is one (see `rim default`).
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM_CLEANREG: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Remove R and Rtools entries from the registry, if the corresponding
    R or Rtools versions are not installed any more.
