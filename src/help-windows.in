const HELP_RM: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Remove an R installation. It keeps the users' package libraries.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Various commands to modify and configure the installed R versions.
    See their help pages for details. E.g. run `rim system make-links --help`.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM_LINKS: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Create quick links in `C:\Program Files\R\bin` for the current R
    installations. This lets you directly run a specific R version. E.g.
     `R-4.1` will start R 4.1.x.

    `rim add` runs `rim system make-links`, so if you only use rim to
    install R, then you do not need to run it manually.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM_LIB: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Create directories for the current user's package libraries, for all
    current R versions.

    `rim add` runs `rim system create-lib`, so if you only use rim to
    install R, then you do not need to run it manually.
"#;

const HELP_SYSTEM_ADDPAK: &str = r#"
DESCRIPTION
    Install/update pak for one or more R versions.

    * If `--all` is specified, then it installs pak for all current R
      installations.
    * If one or more R versions are specified, then it installs pak for
      those.
    * If no R versions are specified, then it installs pak for the default
      R installation (see `rim default`).
