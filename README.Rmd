### Auto-complete

The macOS installer and also installs the `zsh` and `bash` completions.
`zsh` completions work out of the box.
For `bash` completions install the `bash-completion` package from Homebrew 
and make sure it is loaded from your `.bashrc`. (You don't need to install
`bash` from Homebrew, but you can if you like.)

## ⚙️&nbsp; Usage

Use `rim add` to add a new R installation:

```
rim add release
```

Use `rim list` to list the currently installed R versions, and `rim default`
to set the default one.

Run `rim` to see all commands and examples:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
rim
```

```{bash, echo = FALSE, error = TRUE}
./target/release/rim
```

Run `rim <subcommand> --help` for information about a subcommand:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
rim default --help
```

```{bash, echo = FALSE}
./target/release/rim default --help
```
