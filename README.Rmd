# The R Installation Manager

Install, remove, configure R versions.

## üöÄ&nbsp; Features

* Works on macOS, Windows and Linux (Ubuntu and Debian, x86_64 and aarch64).
* Easy installation and update, no system requirements on any platform.
* Install multiple R versions.
* Select the default R version, for the terminal and RStudio.
* Select R version to install using symbolic names: `devel`, `next`,
  `release`, `oldrel`, etc.
* Run multiple versions _at the same_ time using quick links.
  E.g. `R-4.1` or `R-4.1.2` starts R 4.1.x. Quick links are automatically
  added to the user's path.
* On M1 macs select between x86_64 and arm64 versions or R, or install both.
* Creates and configures user level package libraries.
* Restricts permissions to the system library.
  (On macOS, not needed on Windows and Linux).
* Includes auto-complete for `zsh` and `bash`, on macOS and Linux.
* Updates R installations to allow debugging with `lldb`, and to allow
  core dumps, on macOS.
* Installs the appropriate Rtools versions on Windows and sets them up.
* Cleans up stale R-related entries from the Windows registry.
* Switches to root/administrator user as needed.

## üêû&nbsp; Known Issues

* On macOS, R.app often does not work if you install multiple R versions.
* On Windows you need to restart your shell or terminal after installing
  Rtools, for the changes to take effect.
* On Windows, `rig rstudio` changes the R version in the registry
  temporarily before starting RStudio and then changes it back after a
  short wait. If RStudio starts up very slowly, then the wait might be
  too short, and it might start up with the wrong R version.
* If you delete the default R version with `rig rm` or another way,
  then the `R` and `RS` commands will kept, but they will point to a
  non-existing directory and fail.
* On Windows Rtools installation will fail if the same version of Rtools is
  already installed.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è&nbsp; Installation

### macOS (installer)

Download the latest release from https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases
and install it the usual way.

### macOS (Homebrew)

If you use Homebrew (Intel or Arm version), you can install rig from our
tap:

```sh
brew tap r-lib/rig
brew install --cask rig
```

You can use x86_64 rig on Arm macs, and it will be able to install Arm
builds of R. But you cannot use Arm rig on Intel macs. If you use both brew
versions, only install rig with one of them.

To update rig you can run

```sh
brew upgrade --cask rig
```

### Windows (installer)

Download the latest release from https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases
and install it the usual way.

`rig` adds itself to the user's path, but you might need to restart your
terminal after the installation on Windows.

### Windows (Scoop)

If you use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), you can install rig from the scoop
bucket at
[`cderv/r-bucket`](https://github.com/cderv/r-bucket#r-installation-manager-rig):

``` powershell
scoop bucket add r-bucket https://github.com/cderv/r-bucket.git
scoop install rig
```

To update run

``` powershell
scoop update rig
```

### Linux

Download the latest releast from https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases
and uncompress it to `/usr/local`

```
curl -Ls https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases/download/v0.4.0/rig-linux-0.4.0.tar.gz |
  sudo tar xz -C /usr/local
```

If you are running Linux on arm64, download the arm64 build:
```
curl -Ls https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases/download/v0.4.0/rig-linux-arm64-0.4.0.tar.gz |
  sudo tar xz -C /usr/local
```

Supported Linux distributions:

- Ubuntu from [r-builds](https://github.com/rstudio/r-builds#r-builds),
  currently 18.04, 20.04, 22.04.
- Debian from [r-builds](https://github.com/rstudio/r-builds#r-builds),
  currently 9, 10 and 11.

Other Linux distributions are coming soon.

### Auto-complete

The macOS and Linux installers also install completion files for `zsh`
and `bash`.

`zsh` completions work out of the box.

For `bash` completions install the `bash-completion` package from Homebrew
or your Linux distribution and make sure it is loaded from your `.bashrc`.
(You don't need to install `bash` from Homebrew, but you can if you like.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è&nbsp; Usage

Use `rig add` to add a new R installation:

```
rig add release
```

Use `rig list` to list the currently installed R versions, and `rig default`
to set the default one.

Run `rig` to see all commands and examples.
