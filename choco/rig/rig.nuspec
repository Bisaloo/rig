# Install, remove, configure multiple R versions.

## Features

-   Works on macOS, Windows and Linux (Ubuntu and Debian, x86_64 and
    aarch64).
-   Easy installation and update, no system requirements on any
    platform.
-   Install multiple R versions.
-   Select the default R version, for the terminal and RStudio.
-   Select R version to install using symbolic names: `devel`, `next`,
    `release`, `oldrel`, etc.
-   Run multiple versions *at the same* time using quick links. E.g.
    `R-4.1` or `R-4.1.2` starts R 4.1.x. Quick links are automatically
    added to the user’s path.
-   On M1 macs select between x86_64 and arm64 versions or R, or install
    both.
-   Creates and configures user level package libraries.
-   Restricts permissions to the system library. (On macOS, not needed
    on Windows and Linux).
-   Includes auto-complete for `zsh` and `bash`, on macOS and Linux.
-   Updates R installations to allow debugging with `lldb`, and to allow
    core dumps, on macOS.
-   Installs the appropriate Rtools versions on Windows and sets them
    up.
-   Cleans up stale R-related entries from the Windows registry.
-   Switches to root/administrator user as needed.

    <releaseNotes>
# rig 0.5.0

* rig can now open renv projects in RStudio, with the correct R version.
  Pass the renv lock file to rig: `rig rstudio .../renv.lock` (#74).

* `rig list` now prints the result as a table, and it prints the R version
  number as well. `rig list --json` includes the version number, the path
  to the installation, and the path to the R binary.

* rig is now more robust when setting up the user library. In
  particular R will not fail to start in renv projects (#81, @krlmlr).

* On macOS and Linux `rig add` now creates the user library with the right
  permissions, if it does not exist and pak is installed (#84).

* `rig add` now correctly installs pak into the user library, instead of
  the system library, even if the user library did not exist before.

## Windows

* On Windows, `rig add ... --without-translations` installs R without
  message translations. This is useful if you prefer using R in
  English on a non-English system (#88).

* On Windows `rig add` does not add a Desktop icon now by default.
  If want an icon, use the new `--with-desktop-icon` switch (#89).

* On Windows, if the default version is deleted, rig updates the
  registry accordingly, and removes the default from there as well (#86).

* New subcommand `rig system update-rtools40` updates MSYS2 packages
  of Rtools40 on Windows (#14).

## macOS

* On macOS `rig add` now does not fail if it is started from an x86_64
  shell, when adding an arm64 R version on M1 Macs (#79).

* On macOS, `rig rstudio [ver]` now errors if R `[ver]` is not orthogonal,
  and the menu bar app errors as well (#90).
