    <releaseNotes>
# rig 0.4.0

## NEW NAME

`rim` is now known as `rig`.

## New features

* Experimental multi-library support. See `rig library --help` for the
  details.

* On macOS rig now includes a menu bar app that show the default R version,
  lets you choose between R versions and libraries, and lets you start
  RStudio with a specific R version, and/or a recent RStudio project.
  Start the app with `open -a Rig`.

* New subcommand `rig system setup-user-lib` to update the R config to create
  the user package library when R starts up, if it does not exist. The old
  `rig system create-lib` subcommand is now an alias of this.

* Better messages. rig has a `-v` and `-vv` flag now, for extra debug and
  trace messages.

* On arm64 macOS, `rig add` installs arm64 R by default now.
  (This is also true for the x86_64 build of `rig`.

* On macOS `rig add` does not change the default R version any more (#2).

* rig now supports Linux distros based on Ubuntu Bionic 18.04, Focal 20.04
  and Jammy 22.04. They need to have a proper `UBUNTU_CODENAME` entry in
  `/etc/os-release` (#34).

* rig now sets up automated system requirements installation with pak on Linux
  distributions that support it: Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and 22.04 (on distros
  based on these), on both x86_64 and aarch64. (This currently needs
  passwordless `sudo` or a root account.)

* All OSes create an `Rscript` link now that runs the default R
  version (#20).
