RIM -- The R Installation Manager 0.1.0

DESCRIPTION
    rim manages your R installations, on macOS and Windows. It can install
    and set up multiple versions R, and it makes sure that they work
    together.

    On macOS R versions installed by rim do not interfere. You can run multiple
    versions at the same time. rim also makes sure that packages installed by
    the user go into a user package library, so reinstalling R will not wipe
    out your installed packages.

    rim is currently work in progress. Feedback is appreciated.
    See https://github.com/gaborcsardi/rim for bug reports and more.

DESCRIPTION
    Print or set the default R version. The default R version is the one that
    is started with the `R` command, usually via the `/usr/local/bin/R`
     symbolic link.

    Call without any arguments to see the current default. Call with the
    version number/name to set the default. Before setting a default, you
    can call `rim list` to see the installed R versions.

    The default R version is set by updating the symbolic link at
    `/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/Current` and pointing it to the
    specified R version.

    Potentially you need to run this command with `sudo` to change the
    default version: `sudo rim default ...`.

    You don't need to update the default R version to just run a non-default R
    version. You can use the `R-<ver>` links, see `rim system make-links`.

USAGE:
    rim default [version]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help
            Prints help information

    -V, --version
            Prints version information


ARGS:
    <version>
            new default R version to set


EXAMPLES:
    # Query default R version
    rim default

    # Set the default version
    rim default 4.1
```
