# The R Installation Manager

Install, remove, configure R versions.

## üöÄ¬† Features

-   Works on macOS, Windows and Linux (Ubuntu and Debian).
-   Install multiple R versions, select the default one.
-   Select R version to install using symbolic names: `devel`,
    `release`, `oldrel`, etc.
-   Run multiple versions *at the same* time using quick links. E.g.
    `R-4.1` or `R-4.1.2` starts R 4.1.x. Quick links are automatically
    added to the user‚Äôs path.
-   On M1 macs select between x86_64 and arm64 versions or R, or install
    both.
-   Creates and configures user level package libraries.
-   Restricts permissions to the system library. (On macOS, not needed
    on Windows and Linux).
-   Includes auto-complete for `zsh` and `bash`, on macOS and Linux.
-   Updates R installations to allow debugging with `lldb`, and to allow
    core dumps, on macOS.
-   Installs the appropriate Rtools versions on Windows and sets them
    up.
-   Cleans up stale R-related entries from the Windows registry.
-   Switches to root/administrator user as needed.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è¬† Installation

### macOS (installer)

Download the latest release from
<https://github.com/gaborcsardi/rim/releases> and install it the usual
way.

### macOS (Homebrew)

If you use Homebrew (Intel or Arm version), you can install rim from our
tap:

``` sh
brew tap gaborcsardi/rim
brew install --cask rim
```

You can use x86_64 rim on Arm macs, and it will be able to install Arm
builds of R. But you cannot use Arm rim on Intel macs. If you use both
brew versions, only install rim with one of them.

### Windows

Download the latest release from
<https://github.com/gaborcsardi/rim/releases> and install it the usual
way.

`rim` adds itself to the user‚Äôs path, but you might need to restart your
terminal after the installation on Windows.

### Linux

Download the latest releast from
<https://github.com/gaborcsardi/rim/releases> and uncompress it to
`/usr/local`

    curl -OL https://github.com/gaborcsardi/rim/releases/download/v0.2.0/rim-linux-0.2.0.tar.gz
    sudo tar xzf rim-linux-0.2.0.tar.gz -C /usr/local

Supported Linux distributions:

-   Ubuntu from
    [r-builds](https://github.com/rstudio/r-builds#r-builds), currently
    18.04, 20.04, 22.04.
-   Debian from
    [r-builds](https://github.com/rstudio/r-builds#r-builds), currently
    9 and 10.

Other Linux distributions are coming soon.

### Auto-complete

The macOS and Linux installers also install completion files for `zsh`
and `bash`.

`zsh` completions work out of the box.

For `bash` completions install the `bash-completion` package from
Homebrew or your Linux distribution and make sure it is loaded from your
`.bashrc`. (You don‚Äôt need to install `bash` from Homebrew, but you can
if you like.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è¬† Usage
